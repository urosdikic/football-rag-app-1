    """The most admitted story tells that the game was developed in England in the 12th century. In this century, games that resembled football were played on meadows and roads in England. Besides from kicks, the game involved also punches of the ball with the fist. This early form of football was also much more rough and violent than the modern way of playing. 
    
    Another important event in the history of football came about in 1863 in London when the first Football association was formed in England. It was decided that carrying the ball with the hands wasn't allowed. The meeting also resulted in a standardization of the size and weight of the ball. A consequence of the London meeting was that the game was divided into two codes: association football and rugby. The game would, however, continue to develop for a long time and therewas still much flexibility concerning the rules. For one thing, the number of players on the pitch could vary. Neither were uniforms used to distinguish the appearance of the teams. It was also common with players wearing caps – the header was yet to be a part of the game yet. 
    
    Another important difference at this stage could be noticed between English and Scottish teams. Whereas the English teams preferred to run forward with the ball in a more rugby fashion, the Scottish chose to pass the ball between their players. It would be the Scottish approach that soon became predominant. The sport was at first an entertainment for the British working class. Unprecedented amounts of spectators, up to 30,000, would see the big matches in the late 19th century. The game would soon expand by British peoples who traveled to other parts of the world and as a result to the British colonization efforts. Especially in South America and India would the interest in football become big.""",

    """Football clubs have existed since the 15th century, but unorganized and without official status. It is therefore hard to decide which the first football club was. Some historians suggest that it was the Foot-Ball Club formed 1824 in Edinburgh. Early clubs were often formed by former school students and the first of this kind was formed in Sheffield in 1855. The oldest among professional football clubs is the English club Notts County that was formed in 1862 and still exists today. 
    
    An important step for the emergence of teams was the industrialization that led to larger groups of people meeting at places such as factories, pubs and churches. Football teams were established in the larger cities and the new railroads could bring them to other cities. In the beginning, football was dominated by public school teams, but later, teams consisting by workers would make up the majority. Another change was successively taking place when some clubs became willing to pay the best players to join their team. This would be the start of a long period of transition, not without friction, in which the game would develop to a professional level. The motivation behind paying players was not only to win more matches. 
    
    In the 1880s the interest in the game has moved ahead to a level that tickets were sold to the matches. And finally, in 1885 professional football was legalized and three years later the Football League was established. During the first season, 12 clubs joined the league, but soon more clubs became interested and the competition would consequently expand into more divisions. For a long time, the British teams would be dominant. After some decades, clubs from Prague, Budapest and Sienna would be the primarily contenders to the British dominance. As with many things in history, women were for a long time excluded from participating in games. It was not before the late 19th century that women started to play football. The first official women's game took place in Inverness in 1888.""",

    """Other milestones were now to follow. Football Association Challenge Cup (FA Cup) became the first important competition when it was run in 1871. The following year, a match between two national teams was played for the first time. The match that involved England and Scotland ended 0-0 and was followed by 4,000 people at Hamilton Crescent (the picture shows illustrations from this occasion). 
    
    Twelve years later, in 1883, the first international tournament took place and included four national teams: England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales. Football was for a long time a British phenomenon, but it gradually spread to other European countries. The first game that took place outside Europe occurred in Argentina in 1867, but it was foreign British workers who were involved and not Argentinean citizens. The Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) was founded in 1904 and a foundation act was signed by representatives from France, Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland. England and the other British countries did not join FIFA from the start, they had invented the game and saw no reason to subordinate to an association. Still, they joined in the following year, but would not partake in the World Cup until 1950. Domestic leagues occurred in many countries. The first was, as already mentioned, the English Football League which was established in 1888. The leagues would by time expand by more divisions, which were based on team performance. In 1908 would football for the first time be included as an official sport in the Olympic Games. Until the first FIFA World Cup was played in 1930, the Olympic Games football tournament would rank as the most prestigious on a national level. Women's football was not added until 1996.""",

    """The aim of football is to score more goals then your opponent in a 90 minute playing time frame. The match is split up into two halves of 45 minutes. After the first 45 minutes players will take a 15 minute rest period called half time. The second 45 minutes will resume and any time deemed fit to be added on by the referee (injury time) will be accordingly.

    Each team consists of 11 players. These are made up of one goalkeeper and ten outfield players. The pitch dimensions vary from each ground but are roughly 120 yards long and 75 yards wide. On each pitch you will have a 6 yard box next to the goal mouth, an 18 yard box surrounding the 6 yard box and a centre circle. Each half of the pitch must be a mirror image of the other in terms of dimensions.
    
    Essentially the equipment that is needed for a soccer match is pitch and a football. Additionally players can be found wearing studded football boots, shin pads and matching strips. The goalkeepers will additionally wear padded gloves as they are the only players allowed to handle the ball. Each team will have a designated captain.
    
    To score the ball must go into your opponent’s goal. The whole ball needs to be over the line for it to be a legitimate goal. A goal can be scored with any part of the body apart from the hand or arm up to the shoulder. The goal itself consists of a frame measuring 8 feet high and 8 yards wide.
    
    To win you have to score more goals than that of your opponents. If the scores are level after 90 minutes then the game will end as a draw apart from in cup games where the game can go to extra time and even a penalty shootout to decide the winner. Players must use their feet to kick the ball and are prohibited to use their hands apart from goalkeepers who can use any part of their body within the 18 yard box.""",

    """•	A match consists of two 45 minutes halves with a 15 minute rest period in between.
    •	Each team can have a minimum off 11 players (including 1 goalkeeper who is the only player allowed to handle the ball within the 18 yard box) and a minimum of 7 players are needed to constitute a match.
    •	The field must be made of either artificial or natural grass. The size of pitches is allowed to vary but must be within 100-130 yards long and 50-100 yards wide. The pitch must also be marked with a rectangular shape around the outside showing out of bounds, two six yard boxes, two 18 yard boxes and a centre circle. A spot for a penalty placed 12 yards out of both goals and centre circle must also be visible.
    •	The ball must have a circumference of 58-61cm and be of a circular shape.
    •	Each team can name up to 7 substitute players. Substitutions can be made at any time of the match with each team being able to make a maximum of 3 substitutions per side. In the event of all three substitutes being made and a player having to leave the field for injury the team will be forced to play without a replacement for that player.
    •	Each game must include one referee and two assistant referee’s (linesmen). It’s the job of the referee to act as time keeper and make any decisions which may need to be made such as fouls, free kicks, throw ins, penalties and added on time at the end of each half. The referee may consult the assistant referees at any time in the match regarding a decision. It’s the assistant referee’s job to spot offside’s in the match (see below), throw ins for either team and also assist the referee in all decision making processes where appropriate.
    •	If the game needs to head to extra time as a result of both teams being level in a match then 30 minutes will be added in the form of two 15 minute halves after the allotted 90 minutes.
    •	If teams are still level after extra time then a penalty shootout must take place.
    •	The whole ball must cross the goal line for it to constitute as a goal.
    •	For fouls committed a player could receive either a yellow or red card depending on the severity of the foul; this comes down to the referee’s discretion. The yellow is a warning and a red card is a dismissal of that player. Two yellow cards will equal one red. Once a player is sent off then they cannot be replaced.
    •	If a ball goes out of play off an opponent in either of the side lines then it is given as a throw in. If it goes out of play off an attacking player on the base line then it is a goal kick. If it comes off a defending player it is a corner kick.""",

    """Offside can be called when an attacking player is in front of the last defender when the pass is played through to them. The offside area is designed to discourage players from simply hanging around the opponent’s goal waiting for a pass. To be onside they must be placed behind the last defender when the ball is played to them. If the player is in front of that last defender then he is deemed to be offside and free kick to the defending team will be called. A player cannot be caught offside in their own half. The goalkeeper does not count as a defender. If the ball is played backwards and the player is in front of the last defender then he is deemed to be not offside.""",

    """Formation, as most fans know, is the arrangement of players on the field. This is typically expressed as a series of numbers (e.g., 4-4-2, 3-5-2) that indicate the number of players in each horizontal line of the tactical setup. It’s the starting point from which coaches build their game plan.
    
    On the other hand, shape refers to how the team looks during play, which is not always consistent with their formation. It’s about the fluidity of players’ positioning, and is greatly influenced by whether the team has possession, where the ball is located, and their intended strategy at any given moment.""",

    """Often, discussions about formation revolve around how many defenders, midfielders, and forwards are deployed. However, understanding the offensive shape can reveal a side’s true intentions and capability. For instance, a 4-3-3 formation can manifest as a staggered diamond in the midfield when the team is in possession. This allows for a strong pressing game and quick, dynamic wing play. Similarly, a 4-4-2 might shift to a flat four in midfield, offering a more balanced approach between attacking and defending.
    
    A team’s defensive shape is equally illuminating; it’s their first line of resistance against the opponent’s advances. Traditionally, a team might drop into a 4-4-2 or a 5-4-1 when under pressure. However, it’s the intricacies of player positioning within these formations that truly dictate the team’s ability to close down spaces and mark opponents. This involves a mix of zonal marking and man-to-man coverage, all while maintaining the integrity of the defensive shape to avoid becoming disjointed.
    
    One of the most crucial—and least appreciated—aspects of shape is how a team handles the transition from offense to defense and vice versa. This in-between phase is often when teams are most vulnerable, and the successful management of this dynamic can lead to turnovers or prevent counter-attacks.
    
    During an attacking phase, players must anticipate the potential loss of possession and adjust their positioning to make the transition to defense as smooth as possible. Conversely, the defending team must be ready to exploit any lapses as the ball changes hands. A good transition shape ensures that the team remains a cohesive unit, able to adapt swiftly to either mode of play.""",

    """The 4-3-3 is the most widespread system in modern football. Used by teams like Manchester City, Real Madrid, or PSG, it’s known for its balance between defense and attack. The wide wingers provide width, the three midfielders control the game’s rhythm, and the striker is the offensive reference point.
    
    Another key modern formation is the 4-2-3-1, widely used by national teams and top European clubs. It relies on two defensive midfielders who provide stability and a playmaker who operates between the lines, connecting with the striker.
    
    The 3-5-2 has made a comeback in recent years thanks to managers like Antonio Conte and Thomas Tuchel. The key lies in the wing-backs, players who must possess enormous physical and tactical endurance as they cover the entire flank.
    
    Although some see it as a system of the past, the 4-4-2 is still alive, especially in teams that prioritize defensive solidity and structure. With two compact lines and two mobile strikers, it becomes an effective tool for pressing and counterattacking.
    
    Used by national teams like Italy or Croatia, the 5-3-2 is a defensive variation of the 3-5-2. It provides maximum security at the back, with three center-backs and two wing-backs dropping deep to form a line of five.
    
    Finally, the 4-1-4-1 has gained popularity in recent years due to its ability to maintain possession and protect the midfield zone. The defensive midfielder acts as an anchor, while the four midfielders contribute pressure and attacking support.""",
